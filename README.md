# zombie-undead-detector
A robust, production-ready Python tool for detecting zombie and undead processes on Linux systems. This script identifies problematic processes using multiple heuristics, ignoring kernel threads, and provides detailed output in a compact ASCII table or JSON format. It supports daemon mode for continuous monitoring and container-aware detection.
